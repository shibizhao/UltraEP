UltraEP is a lightweight yet high-performance expert load balancing library for large-scale MoE training and inference. In expert parallelism (EP), load imbalance across GPUs creates a significant gap between ideal (perfect balancing) and achievable throughput. Instead of relying on stale load history, UltraEP rebalances on the **exact** post-gating load in **real time**: it replicates hot experts and reroutes tokens within every layer of every microbatch, to achieve **near-optimal** end-to-end performance.

UltraEP is a production-ready, full-stack solution built on the following principles:

- **Self-contained codebase.** As an independent Python/CUDA runtime, UltraEP is decoupled from token dispatcher (e.g., DeepEP) or grouped GEMM. Integrating it into a training or inference framework takes only a few hundred lines.
- **Topology-aware replication.** Confining expert replication to the scale-up fabric, UltraEP adapts to available NVLink domain size automatically. When the NVLink domain is smaller than the EP group, the achievable imbalance floor sits slightly above the ideal 1.0.
- **Efficient, GPU-native kernels.** Highly optimized GPU-resident kernels for balancing plan solving and expert communication. Exposed overhead is under 300 µs at large-scale EP, typically 1%–2% of end-to-end step time.
- **Broad compatibility.** Supports DP/PP/VPP, activation checkpointing, low precision, and CUDA graph.
- **Memory-efficient.** Cross-layer reuse of replica weight/gradient buffers minimizes additional VRAM usage, with no dynamic allocation at runtime.

## News

- [2026/07/15] ✨ Released UltraEP v1.0.0, which has been deployed in our production MoE training.

## End-to-End Integration & Performance

We provide a fork of [Megatron-LM](https://github.com/Dots-Infra/Megatron-LM-UltraEP) as a reference integration of UltraEP. For a quick start, the [Megatron-LM Training with UltraEP](examples/README.md) guide includes an **8×Hopper runnable demo** with reproducible balancing gains under real training load, plus a Qwen3-235B recipe. SGLang inference integration is currently experimental and will be released once production-ready.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/assets/images/blog-eval_highlights.webp" alt="UltraEP evaluation highlights" width="90%"></p>

We display the overall performance on representative MoE models. Training uses EP64 (scaled by DP/PP); serving prefill uses EP40/EP64. UltraEP shows significant improvements and stays close to the force-balanced ceiling. Check our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.04101) for detailed evaluation results.

## Installation

The requirements are:

- NVIDIA GPUs with SM90 or SM100
- Python >= 3.10 and PyTorch >= 2.10
- Compiler with C++17 support
- CUDA Toolkit:
    - CUDA 12.3 or higher for SM90
    - CUDA 12.9 or higher for SM100
- NVLink/P2P access among the GPUs within each NVLink domain
- A PyTorch build exposing `torch.distributed._symmetric_memory` with either
  the CUDA or NCCL Symmetric Memory allocator enabled. UltraEP prefers CUDA and
  falls back to the Symmetric Memory NCCL allocator when a build does not
  register the CUDA allocator; neither path depends on NVSHMEM

Then build and install. The builder can auto-detect CUDA compute capability; if failed, explicitly set `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` to `9.0` (SM90) or `10.0` (SM100).

```bash
python setup.py install
```

UltraEP does not link against or initialize NVSHMEM. At manager construction,
the Python layer allocates the replica buffers with PyTorch Symmetric Memory,
rendezvouses them within each detected NVLink domain, and passes the resulting
peer-pointer tables to the CUDA extension. Placement collectives still span
the full EP process group. As before, equally sized NVLink domains must occupy
contiguous EP-rank blocks; `MAX_NUM_NVL_PEERS` can restrict the detected size.
For an NVL72 host with EP16, pass the EP process group of size 16.

You're all set! Simply import `ultra_ep` in your Python project and get started.

## Interface

### 1. Initialization

Create one `Manager` instance per EP group. On each rank, UltraEP reserves the same number of redundant-expert slots, i.e., weight/gradient buffers reused across layers. For each layer, the external framework registers its inherent master experts' weight/gradient pointers with UltraEP for replication/reduction, and uses the redundant buffers exposed by UltraEP for MoE forward and backward compute.

```python
# (1) Initialize UltraEP Manager per EP group
manager = ultra_ep.Manager(
    group=ep_group,
    num_layers=num_layers,
    num_local_master_experts=num_experts // ep_size,
    num_local_redundant_experts=R, # redundant slots reserved per rank
    expert_fc1_numel=2 * hidden_size * moe_ffn_hidden_size,
    expert_fc2_numel=hidden_size * moe_ffn_hidden_size,
    is_train=True,
    max_microbatches=max_inflight_mbatches, # > 1 for PP/VPP, else 1
    weight_data_dtype=torch.bfloat16, # expert weight dtype
    grad_dtype=torch.float32,
    ## FP8 experts: also pass the scale dtype and numels
    # weight_scale_dtype=torch.uint8,
    # expert_fc1_weight_scale_numel=...,
    # expert_fc2_weight_scale_numel=...,
)

# (2) UltraEP exposes redundant-expert buffers,
#   which are reused across layers:
#     manager.local_replica_{fc1,fc2}_weight_buffer
#     manager.local_replica_{fc1,fc2}_grad_buffer
# (3) Register the inherent experts' weight/grad pointers per layer:
manager.construct_local_master_ptr_pool(
    layer_id, fc1_weights, fc2_weights, fc1_grads, fc2_grads
)
```

### 2. Forward and backward

After routing in the forward pass, `update_placement` computes the per-microbatch replication plan from the exact load, and `weight_sync` materializes it by distributing master weights to replica slots; both are on the critical path. `reroute` expands logical routing to physical replicas in forward and gathers gradients back to logical experts in backward. Backward reuses the saved virtual layer slot to restore replica weights before expert Dgrad, then asynchronously reduces replica Wgrad into master-expert gradients via `grad_reduce`, overlapping the reduction with router and attention backward.

```python
# --- Backward-only UltraEP hooks (identity in the forward) ---
class RestoreReplicaWeights(torch.autograd.Function):
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x, manager, vid):
        ctx.manager, ctx.vid = manager, vid; return x
    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, g):
        # [UltraEP] redistribute weights to replicas
        ctx.manager.weight_sync(ctx.vid, async_finish=False)
        return g, None, None

class StartGradReduce(torch.autograd.Function):
    # forward: identity ...
    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, g):
        # [UltraEP] start async replica -> master expert gradient reduce
        ctx.manager.gr_event = ctx.manager.grad_reduce(
            ctx.vid, async_finish=True
        ); return g, None, None

class JoinGradReduce(torch.autograd.Function):
    # forward: identity ...
    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, g):
        # join grad_reduce here, after the attention backward
        ctx.manager.gr_event.current_stream_wait(); return g, None

# --- One transformer layer (its backward is autograd-derived) ---
def transformer_layer(hidden, manager, layer_id):
    vid = manager.allocate_microbatch_slot(layer_id)  # PP/VPP-safe slot
    # [UltraEP, bwd-only] join grad_reduce at bwd tail
    hidden = JoinGradReduce.apply(hidden, manager)
    # --- Attention ---
    hidden = hidden + self_attention(hidden)
    # --- MoE ---
    residual = hidden
    probs, routing_map = router(hidden) # gating -> logical routing map
    # [UltraEP, fwd-only] plan replication from the exact global load
    manager.update_placement(vid, routing_map)
    # [UltraEP, fwd-only] distribute master-expert weights to replicas
    ws_event = manager.weight_sync(vid, async_finish=True)
    # [UltraEP, fwd/bwd] logical <-> physical routing (hidden under weight_sync)
    probs, routing_map = manager.reroute(vid, probs, routing_map)
    # [UltraEP, fwd-only] join weight_sync before token dispatch
    ws_event.current_stream_wait()

    # [UltraEP, bwd-only] start grad_reduce after expert bwd (async)
    hidden = StartGradReduce.apply(hidden, manager, vid)  
    recv_tokens = dispatch(hidden, probs, routing_map)
    recv_tokens = experts(recv_tokens, probs)  # grouped GEMM over physical experts
    out = combine(recv_tokens)
    # [UltraEP, bwd-only] restore weights before expert Dgrad (blocking)
    out = RestoreReplicaWeights.apply(out, manager, vid)
    return residual + out
```

## Tests

`test_solving.py` runs a single-GPU placement/reroute solving with synthesized Zipf-distributed expert loads at target rank-level imbalance ratios (max/mean). `test_e2e.py` runs the distributed runtime path and further evaluates communication kernels for latency and bitwise correctness.

```bash
# Single-GPU placement/reroute simulation
python tests/test_solving.py

# Distributed runtime test
# Adjust the settings to match your cluster configuration
torchrun --nproc_per_node $GPUS_PER_NODE --nnodes $NNODES --node_rank $NODE_RANK \
    --master_addr $MASTER_ADDR --master_port $MASTER_PORT \
    tests/test_e2e.py --num-experts 256
```

Symmetric-memory and synchronization regressions can be run on two or four GPUs:

```bash
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=2 tests/test_buffer_sync.py --graph
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=2 tests/test_buffer_sync.py --sync --non-deterministic
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=2 tests/test_buffer_sync.py --graph --previous-event --current-stream
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 tests/test_symmetric_memory.py --subgroups
MAX_NUM_NVL_PEERS=2 torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 tests/test_symmetric_memory.py
```

The table below reports an original NVSHMEM-based EP64, 256-expert `test_e2e.py` run (4 master + 2 redundant experts/rank, topk = 8, tokens/rank = 8k, bf16 weights, 42 SMs for grad-reduce). The 1.01 final imbalance corresponds to the default balancing tolerance (`ULTRA_EP_QUOTA_ORACLE_EPS=0.01`):

| Initial imbalance (max/mean) | **1.51** | **2.01** | **3.03** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Final imbalance (max/mean) | 1.01 | 1.01 | 1.01 |
| `update_placement` | 0.067 ms | 0.072 ms | 0.078 ms |
| `reroute` | 0.039 ms | 0.037 ms | 0.036 ms |
| `weight_sync` (direct, no relay) | 0.214 ms | 0.265 ms | 0.317 ms |
| Critical-path bandwidth | 706 GB/s | 712 GB/s | 715 GB/s |
| `weight_sync` (adaptive relay) | 0.194 ms | 0.195 ms | 0.188 ms |
| `grad_reduce` (overlapped) | 1.935 ms | 2.181 ms | 2.425 ms |
| Replicas (max per expert / total) | 4 / 38 | 5 / 46 | 6 / 51 |

## Performance Tuning

Algorithm and kernel behaviors are controlled entirely through `ULTRA_EP_*` environment variables.

**Expert communication**

- `ULTRA_EP_GRAD_REDUCE_NUM_SMS` (default `42`): SMs reserved for the persistent grad-reduce kernel. *Tune this to your model:* profile the training and pick a small value that ensures grad-reduce is hidden fully behind the router/attention backward.
- `ULTRA_EP_GRAD_REDUCE_DETERMINISTIC` (default `1`): use the deterministic, non-atomic gradient reduction.
- `ULTRA_EP_WEIGHT_SYNC_PLAN_MODE` (default `adaptive`): weight distribution plan, one of `direct`, `adaptive`, `force_relay`. Forced to `direct` when the NVLink domain has ≤ 8 GPUs.
- `ULTRA_EP_WEIGHT_SYNC_RELAY_MIN_REPLICAS` (default `4`): minimum replica count per expert before adaptive relay is eligible.
- `ULTRA_EP_WEIGHT_SYNC_RELAY_MAX_RELAYS` (default `8`): maximum relays in a staged plan.
- `ULTRA_EP_WEIGHT_SYNC_RELAY_MIN_FANOUT_GAIN` (default `2`): minimum fanout gain required to switch to relay.

**Replication planning**

- `ULTRA_EP_BALANCE_THRESHOLD` (default `1.0`): early-stop target for the balancing binary search.
- `ULTRA_EP_QUOTA_ORACLE_EPS` (default `0.01`): numerical tolerance for the balancing ratio.
- `ULTRA_EP_QUOTA_LOCALITY_AWARE` (default `1`): locality-aware per-rank quota decomposition to cut remote traffic.
- `ULTRA_EP_QUOTA_MIN_TOKENS_PER_REPLICA` (default `1024`): minimal load allocated to a replica.
- `ULTRA_EP_QUOTA_ALLOW_ZERO_MASTER_QUOTA` (default `0`): allow zero-load master expert.
- `ULTRA_EP_QUOTA_KERNEL_STAGE` (default `1`): quota kernel stage (`0` or `1`).
- `ULTRA_EP_QUOTA_REROUTE_INTERLEAVE` (default `1`): interleave token order to avoid congestion in subsequent dispatch.

**Symmetric Memory and placement metadata**

- `torch.distributed._symmetric_memory.set_backend("CUDA")` is selected once
  before the first replica-buffer allocation, with a fallback to the
  Symmetric Memory `"NCCL"` allocator for PyTorch builds where the CUDA
  allocator is not registered. Set `ULTRA_EP_SYMMETRIC_MEMORY_BACKEND` to
  `CUDA` or `NCCL` to make the choice explicit. The `empty`/`rendezvous` calls
  are initialization-time collectives and must occur in the same order on every
  EP rank. UltraEP creates an eagerly initialized NCCL subgroup for each
  NVLink domain, including when the caller supplies a lazily initialized group.
- Replica weights, gradients, and relay flags use Symmetric Memory; C++ keeps
  only tensor views and device-side peer-pointer tables. Python owns the
  handles and allocation lifetime.
- Placement metadata uses ordinary CUDA tensors. Each rank computes local
  expert loads, then the EP group runs `dist.all_reduce` (legacy mode) or
  `dist.all_gather_into_tensor` (quota mode), all on UltraEP's communication
  stream before the placement solver is launched.
- Weight-sync and grad-reduce always issue stream-ordered Symmetric Memory
  barriers before and after remote buffer access. All ranks in each domain,
  including ranks without local tasks, must call in the same order. The returned
  event (or caller-stream wait) includes incoming writes and remote reads/clears.
  These barriers support CUDA graph capture. Relay graph replay retains the
  existing host-epoch limitation; use direct mode for captured weight-sync.
- Call `manager.destroy()` collectively before destroying the EP process group.
  Release captured graphs and user-held replica-buffer views first. Multiple
  managers can share an EP group. Buffers are released by `destroy()`; domain
  communicators are reused across managers and released by the final global
  `torch.distributed.destroy_process_group()` call.

### Load profiler and viewer

An optional profiler records per-microbatch, per-expert load before and after reroute with minor overhead, so you can diagnose the balancing effect instead of inferring it from end-to-end throughput.

- `ULTRA_EP_LOAD_PROFILING` (default `0`): enable tracing.
- `ULTRA_EP_LOAD_PROFILE_DIR` (default `$PWD/ultra_ep_traces`): trace output directory.
- `ULTRA_EP_LOAD_PROFILE_RECORD_INTERVAL` / `ULTRA_EP_LOAD_PROFILE_FLUSH_INTERVAL` (defaults `1` / `128`): how often traces are recorded and flushed to disk.

Launch the HTML viewer to browse balancing statistics and drill into rank- and expert-level details of each EP group, layer, and microbatch:

```bash
python -m ultra_ep.load_viewer --path <trace_dir> --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8765
```
